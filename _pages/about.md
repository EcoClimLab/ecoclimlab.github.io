The ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Lab is part of the Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO), a global network of forest research plots and scientists dedicated to the study of forest function and diversity. We are based at Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia, USA and are also part of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. 

Research in our lab employs a variety of methods including data synthesis, field research, and modeling to understanding how global change is altering forests around the world and how changes to forest ecosystems will either mitigate or exacerbate climate change.

Dr. Kristina J. Anderson-Teixeira leads the lab and the ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Program.
