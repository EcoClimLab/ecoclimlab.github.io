The ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Lab is part of the [Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO)](https://forestgeo.si.edu), a global network of forest research plots and scientists dedicated to the study of forest function and diversity. 
We are based at [Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute (NZCBI)](https://www.google.com/url) in Front Royal, Virginia, USA
and are also affiliated with the [Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)](https://stri.si.edu/) in Panama. 

Dr. Kristina J. Anderson-Teixeira leads the lab and the [ForestGEO Ecosystems & Climate Program](https://forestgeo.si.edu/research-programs/ecosystems-and-climate-program).
